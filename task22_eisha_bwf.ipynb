        "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data. The algorithm learns to map the input data to the correct output based on the labeled data. The goal of supervised learning is to create a model that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen inputs. Examples of supervised learning include image classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.\n",

        "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using unlabeled data. The algorithm learns to find patterns and structure in the input data without any explicit guidance on what to look for. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden structure in the data that can be used for further analysis or to guide decision-making. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",

        "Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using a supervised task that is generated from the input data itself, rather than from labeled data. This allows the algorithm to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data without the need for explicit labeling. Self-supervised learning has been used for a variety of tasks, including image and video analysis, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n",

The algorithm learns to take actions that maximize the rewards over time. Reinforcement learning has been used for a variety of tasks, including game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving.\n",
